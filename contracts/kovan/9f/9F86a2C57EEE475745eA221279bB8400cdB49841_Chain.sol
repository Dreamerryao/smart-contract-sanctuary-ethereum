 * @dev Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow
 * checks.
 *
 * Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow. This can easily result
 * in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an
 * error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.
 * `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an
 * operation overflows.
 *
 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
 * class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.

 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev PURPOSE
 *
 * @dev Reggie the Random Oracle (not his real job) wants to provide randomness
 * @dev to Vera the verifier in such a way that Vera can be sure he's not
 * @dev making his output up to suit himself. Reggie provides Vera a public key
 * @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to
 * @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely
 * @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.
 *
 * @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was
 * @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,
 * @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample
 * @dev from the output space.
 *
 * @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts
 * @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide
 * @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness.
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev USAGE
 *
 * @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerBase, and can
 * @dev initialize VRFConsumerBase's attributes in their constructor as
 * @dev shown:
 *
 * @dev   contract VRFConsumer {
 * @dev     constuctor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)
 * @dev       VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator, _link) public {
 * @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>
 * @dev       }
 * @dev   }
 *
 * @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have
 * @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash), and have told you the minimum LINK
 * @dev price for VRF service. Make sure your contract has sufficient LINK, and
 * @dev call requestRandomness(keyHash, fee, seed), where seed is the input you
 * @dev want to generate randomness from.
 *
 * @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response
 * @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomness method.
 *
 * @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomness is the actual random value
 * @dev generated from your seed.
 *
 * @dev The requestId argument is generated from the keyHash and the seed by
 * @dev makeRequestId(keyHash, seed). If your contract could have concurrent
 * @dev requests open, you can use the requestId to track which seed is
 * @dev associated with which randomness. See VRFRequestIDBase.sol for more
 * @dev details. (See "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS" for principles to keep in mind,
 * @dev if your contract could have multiple requests in flight simultaneously.)
 *
 * @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds
 * @dev differ. (Which is critical to making unpredictable randomness! See the
 * @dev next section.)
 *
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
 *
 * @dev A method with the ability to call your fulfillRandomness method directly
 * @dev could spoof a VRF response with any random value, so it's critical that
 * @dev it cannot be directly called by anything other than this base contract
 * @dev (specifically, by the VRFConsumerBase.rawFulfillRandomness method).
 *
 * @dev For your users to trust that your contract's random behavior is free
 * @dev from malicious interference, it's best if you can write it so that all
 * @dev behaviors implied by a VRF response are executed *during* your
 * @dev fulfillRandomness method. If your contract must store the response (or
 * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any
 * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be
 * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.
 *
 * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence
 * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if
 * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,
 * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot
 * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.
 *
 * @dev Since the ultimate input to the VRF is mixed with the block hash of the
 * @dev block in which the request is made, user-provided seeds have no impact
 * @dev on its economic security properties. They are only included for API
 * @dev compatability with previous versions of this contract.
 *
 * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness
 * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful
 * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block
 * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a
 * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input
 * @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic
 * @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits
 * @dev until it calls responds to a request.

  * ****************************************************************************
  * @dev DESIGN NOTES
  * @dev The VRF algorithm verified here satisfies the full unqiqueness, full
  * @dev collision resistance, and full pseudorandomness security properties.
  * @dev See "SECURITY PROPERTIES" below, and
  * @dev https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-3
  * @dev An elliptic curve point is generally represented in the solidity code
  * @dev as a uint256[2], corresponding to its affine coordinates in
  * @dev GF(FIELD_SIZE).
  * @dev For the sake of efficiency, this implementation deviates from the spec
  * @dev in some minor ways:
  * @dev - Keccak hash rather than the SHA256 hash recommended in
  * @dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.5
  * @dev   Keccak costs much less gas on the EVM, and provides similar security.
  * @dev - Secp256k1 curve instead of the P-256 or ED25519 curves recommended in
  * @dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.5
  * @dev   For curve-point multiplication, it's much cheaper to abuse ECRECOVER
  * @dev - hashToCurve recursively hashes until it finds a curve x-ordinate. On
  * @dev   the EVM, this is slightly more efficient than the recommendation in
  * @dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.4.1.1
  * @dev   step 5, to concatenate with a nonce then hash, and rehash with the
  * @dev   nonce updated until a valid x-ordinate is found.
  * @dev - hashToCurve does not include a cipher version string or the byte 0x1
  * @dev   in the hash message, as recommended in step 5.B of the draft
  * @dev   standard. They are unnecessary here because no variation in the
  * @dev   cipher suite is allowed.
  * @dev - Similarly, the hash input in scalarFromCurvePoints does not include a
  * @dev   commitment to the cipher suite, either, which differs from step 2 of
  * @dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.4.3
  * @dev   . Also, the hash input is the concatenation of the uncompressed
  * @dev   points, not the compressed points as recommended in step 3.
  * @dev - In the calculation of the challenge value "c", the "u" value (i.e.
  * @dev   the value computed by Reggie as the nonce times the secp256k1
  * @dev   generator point, see steps 5 and 7 of
  * @dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.3
  * @dev   ) is replaced by its ethereum address, i.e. the lower 160 bits of the
  * @dev   keccak hash of the original u. This is because we only verify the
  * @dev   calculation of u up to its address, by abusing ECRECOVER.
  * ****************************************************************************
  * @dev   SECURITY PROPERTIES
  * @dev Here are the security properties for this VRF:
  * @dev Full uniqueness: For any seed and valid VRF public key, there is
  * @dev   exactly one VRF output which can be proved to come from that seed, in
  * @dev   the sense that the proof will pass verifyVRFProof.
  * @dev Full collision resistance: It's cryptographically infeasible to find
  * @dev   two seeds with same VRF output from a fixed, valid VRF key
  * @dev Full pseudorandomness: Absent the proofs that the VRF outputs are
  * @dev   derived from a given seed, the outputs are computationally
  * @dev   indistinguishable from randomness.
  * @dev https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/099.pdf, Appendix B contains the proofs
  * @dev for these properties.
  * @dev For secp256k1, the key validation described in section
  * @dev https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.6
  * @dev is unnecessary, because secp256k1 has cofactor 1, and the
  * @dev representation of the public key used here (affine x- and y-ordinates
  * @dev of the secp256k1 point on the standard y^2=x^3+7 curve) cannot refer to
  * @dev the point at infinity.
  * ****************************************************************************
  * @dev OTHER SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
  *
  * @dev The seed input to the VRF could in principle force an arbitrary amount
  * @dev of work in hashToCurve, by requiring extra rounds of hashing and
  * @dev checking whether that's yielded the x ordinate of a secp256k1 point.
  * @dev However, under the Random Oracle Model the probability of choosing a
  * @dev point which forces n extra rounds in hashToCurve is 2⁻ⁿ. The base cost
  * @dev for calling hashToCurve is about 25,000 gas, and each round of checking
  * @dev for a valid x ordinate costs about 15,555 gas, so to find a seed for
  * @dev which hashToCurve would cost more than 2,017,000 gas, one would have to
  * @dev try, in expectation, about 2¹²⁸ seeds, which is infeasible for any
  * @dev foreseeable computational resources. (25,000 + 128 * 15,555 < 2,017,000.)
  * @dev Since the gas block limit for the Ethereum main net is 10,000,000 gas,
  * @dev this means it is infeasible for an adversary to prevent correct
  * @dev operation of this contract by choosing an adverse seed.
  * @dev (See TestMeasureHashToCurveGasCost for verification of the gas cost for
  * @dev hashToCurve.)
  * @dev It may be possible to make a secure constant-time hashToCurve function.
  * @dev See notes in hashToCurve docstring.
