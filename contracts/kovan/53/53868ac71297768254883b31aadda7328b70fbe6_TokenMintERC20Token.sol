/**恭喜你发现了宝藏，Congratulations, you found a treasure
/**
 *The code is Copied from SHIB  On May 18th, 2021，I don’t know how to code, and I’m not good at English，All English comes from Google Translate
 * When I was new to cryptocurrency, the one that made me transfer the first money was shib
 * Now I want to try if I can make a token by myself, starting from scratch like shiba and to the moon
 * Everyone who buys cryptocurrency wants to become a billionaire overnight, of course, so do I
 * I hope this token can help me earn 100 million dollars，So i named it 100 million dollars dream 
 * Follow shib， I will give 40% of the token to God V（Today is May 20thd,I changed my initial thoughts，
 * bcause I saw the news that God V does not want other people to send coins to him, and does not want to be the center of power，So I decided to direct 40% less circulation，
 * now The total issuance is 600,000,000,000,000）
 * and the other 50% （now is 500,000,000,000,000）I locked to Uniswap and threw away the keys
 * I will keep 10% （now is 100,000,000,000,000）for myself，Until they are worth 100 million dollars or more，By then I will be a billionaire，and You will witness this miracle
 * Q：when will it worth 100 million dollars?  A: I don't know ,maybe 1 year，maybe 1 hundred years，maybe 1 hundred million years
 * Q: will We lose money? A： Most people will
 * Q：Why did you write the description into the code A:Because this is the only way I can think of to let you know about this token
 * Q：Will there be follow-up projects? A：no ，this is all
 * Q：Will you promote this? A: no,I am a motherfaker ，I will do nothing just sit back and enjoy

 * 好了 翻译的太累 下边将用中文描写 
 * 大家好，我是一个新韭菜，5月份才进入币圈，制作这个币呢，主要是这几天亏了，只有买的shib还保留着一点利润，没有更多的本钱了，只能出此下册，发币圈钱。。哈哈哈
 * 我来自河北，是一个普通的老百姓，没有什么权势，没有什么钱，发布这个币，只是想做一次梦，万一成真了呢？
 * 我对这个币最开始的规划就是和shib一样的数量一千万亿枚，然后给V神打过去40%，但是最近新闻说v神不想别人再往他那打币了，他不想成为权利的中心，所以我改变了计划，直接改为600万亿枚，去掉了40%，表面上看起来，我的占比好像更多了，多就多吧，= =！ 你咬我啊！
 * 你问我会不会按描述所说的，将一半的币（现在是83.333%，共计500,000,000,000，000））放入uniswap并且丢掉密匙，你放心，我会的，因为这个玩意现在根本不值钱，全拿着价值也就是0
 * 这个币没有社区实验，只有我自己，没有后续的项目，只有我自己，没有任何价值，只有我自己，除非你们加入进来，这样就变成了你们跟我一起做梦。。。
 * 目前没有什么想说的了，希望今天能把这个币发布上去，不知道会不会成功，当你看到了，说明我已经成功了，而且也已经消失了，你不会有我的任何消息，但我会一直躺在沙发上，抱着手机，看着我的币
 * 把我的地址放出来供你们监控 ，你们要是有不想要的币也可以发给我，= =！ 0x0A8a2efB3e6cbf81715d692fD139a537D26dF376
 * 把我将要放到uniswap做成池子的地址并且丢掉密匙的 地址也放出来供你们监控  0xF036cA800EC00513329eAe36660670791E52126d
 * = =！ 再等两天发布吧，今天太贵了 要3000多，前两天才2000多啊。。具体发布时间你们自己查吧 
 * 我什么时候会抛售我手里的token呢？ 我也不知道，不过大概率不会一下子卖太多，因为监管越来越严，一下子都抛了也变不了现，每次卖一点，够我买特斯拉啊，房子啊，娶媳妇啊，旅游啊就行了

 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means

 *
 * *For a detailed writeup see our guide [How to implement supply

 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an `Approval` event is emitted on calls to `transferFrom`.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard `decreaseAllowance` and `increaseAllowance`
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See `IERC20.approve`.
