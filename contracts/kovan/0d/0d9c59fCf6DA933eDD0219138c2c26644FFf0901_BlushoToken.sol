/**
   $BLUSHO is unique community driven marketing platform for crypto projects. Crypto projects
   can create project wallets. Everybody can send $BLUSHO tokens to these wallets. The projects
   are ranked by their current token balance within the blusho ecosystem. Project wallets
   are taxed regularly and funds send to the burn wallet.

   Each trade (buy/sell) transaction incurs a developer fee to fund the development and marketing
   of the ecosystem. Wallet to Wallet transfers don't incur a fee. These are your tokens!

    Total Supply: 100.000.000.000 (100 Billion / Constant)
    Buy/Sell Transaction Limit: 1% of Total Supply (Max 1% of Circulating Supply)
    Developer Tax: 5% (Max 10%)
    Project Tax: 10% (Constant)
    Project Tax Schedule: 1 Week (Min 1 Day, Max 30 Days)
