 * @dev NFT staking contract that rewards stakers with an exact number of ERC20 tokens per day. On deployment, the owner specifies a daily reward rate,
 * and an address that tokens will be pulled from. Neither of these can be changed. Each staked NFT receives the same number of tokens every day. The per NFT
 * rate stays the same even when the number of staked NFTs increases/decreases.
 *
 * A common usecase is for blockchain-based games, where each NFT rewards a certain number of lives per day.
