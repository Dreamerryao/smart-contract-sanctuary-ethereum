 * @title  SeaportModule
 * @author GoblinSax
 * @dev This is a IMarketModule compliant contract used to buy NFTs in OpenSea market.
 * Depending of how the NFT is listed on OpenSea this module can buy the NFT using 2 of the available methods:
 *     - fulfillBasicOder with one of 2 basic route types `ERC20_TO_ERC721` or `ERC20_TO_ERC1155` assuming the order in
 *      question adheres to the following:
 *         - The order only contains a single offer item and startAmount and endAmount are 1.
 *         - The order contains at least one consideration item, and each consideration item have the same ERC20
 *           item type and token.
 *         - The offerer of the order is the recipient of the first consideration item.
 *     - fulfillAdvanceOder assuming the order in question adheres to the following:
 *         - The order only contains a single offer item.
 *         - Each consideration item have the same ERC20 item type and token.
 *         - The numerator of the advance order parameters should be 1.
