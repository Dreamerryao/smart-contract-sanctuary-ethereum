 * @title ThriveCoin Vesting Schedule
 *
 * @dev Implementation of the THRIVE Vesting Contract.
 *
 * ThriveCoin Vesting schedule contract is a generic smart contract that
 * provides locking and vesting calculation for single wallet.
 *
 * Vesting schedule is realized through allocating funds for stakeholder for
 * agreed vesting/locking schedule. The contract acts as a wallet for
 * stakeholder and they can withdraw funds once they become available
 * (see calcVestedAmount method). Funds become available periodically and the
 * stakeholder can check these details at any time by accessing the methods like
 * vested or available.
 *
 * NOTE: funds are sent to contract after instantiation!
 *
 * Implementation is based on these two smart contracts:
 * - https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.5/contracts/finance/VestingWallet.sol
 * - https://github.com/cpu-coin/CPUcoin/blob/master/contracts/IERC20Vestable.sol
 *
 * NOTE: extends openzeppelin v4.3.2 contracts:
 * https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.3.2/contracts/utils/Context.sol
 * https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.3.2/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol
