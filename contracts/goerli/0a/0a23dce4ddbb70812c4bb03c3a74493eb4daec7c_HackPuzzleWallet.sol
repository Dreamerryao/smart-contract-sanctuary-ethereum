/* Solution in console

    First thing that I need to know is that proxies share the storage slots with the logic contract
    Lets check this, call the pendingAdmin variable inside the proxy
    -await contract.call({ data: web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("pendingAdmin()") });
    And then call the owner variable inside the logic contract
    -await contract.owner()

    Surprise! They're the same.
    As I say, proxies contracts and logic contracts share the storage slot

    How is this problem fix in real life?
    Starting the implementation slot of the proxy in a semi-random place, far away from the slots of the logic contract
    _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT == bytes32(uint256(keccak256("eip1967.proxy.implementation")) - 1))

    But how was I able to call a function inside the proxy contract?
    Well actually, we're always calling the proxy contract
    The proxy redirect us to the logic contract throw a delegatecall
    This is why both contracts share storage slots

    But, why the console only let me call methods inside the logic contract?
    Certain explorer will let you pair proxy to implementation and show available functions from there
    This is why we call the methods inside the proxy contract at a low level using call or sendTransaction


    Now, the first slot of the logical contract is owner as well as pendingAdmin of the proxy contract.
    Let's propose a new admin inside the proxy contract in order to override the owner varible of the logic contract
    -web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("proposeNewAdmin(address)") 
    -web3.eth.abi.encodeParameter("address", player)

    Add value 2, without the 0x, at the end of the value 1.
    Now, we have the data to pass
    -await contract.sendTransaction({ data: '0xa637674600000000000000000000000068fb1897b169446968a7c2128d5025c387d14cc0' }); 

    Congrats! You're the owner of the PuzzleWallet
    Now, you need to whitelist your address
    -await contract.addToWhitelist(player)
