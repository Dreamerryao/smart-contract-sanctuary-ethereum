    // (iii) "GSKNNFT BURNTOMINT ERC721A Contract" and any associated documentation, materials, codebase, contracts, smart contract, 

// OWNER ACKNOWLEDGES RECEIPT AND UNDERSTANDING OF THIS OWNER AGREEMENT, AND AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS.
// OWNER’S ACCEPTANCE OF A DIGITAL ASSET SHALL BE DEEMED ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AND CONSENT TO BE GOVERNED THEREBY.
// IF THE OWNER DOES NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, THIS LICENSE AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATES.

// In consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

// 1. LICENSES & RESTRICTIONS.
    // 1.1 NFT. These “NFTs” are defined as non-fungible tokens.
    // Ownership of which this specific collection is registered on the ethereum blockchain as;
        // Name: “The ApeFathers NFT” (the “Business”) - the NFT "project" operations, employees, agents, representatives and subcontractors,
        // Token Tracker: “DAPES” (the “Token”) - the tracker ID for the Digital Assets on the ethereum blockchain,
        // Contract: “ApeFathers.sol” (the “NFT Contract”) - this specific contract deployed on the ethereum blockchain,
        // Artist: "Tahliazr" (the "Artist") - designed and created the traits conceptualized by GSKNNFT Inc., and furthermore signed the contract ("NFT Licensing Agreement") to transfer the Licenses of the traits created by their ("The Artist's") own hand,
        // Artist Contract: ("NFT Licensing Agreement") - Contract for the transfer of original Intellectual Property of the individual trait images created by The Artist and formally signed by both parties (The Artist and GSKNNFT Inc.),
        // Created by: (“Licensor”) - Gordon Skinner of GSKNNFT Inc. ("@GSKNNFT", "gsknnft.eth", "[email protected]").

    // For the case of this NFT Owner Agreement; any NFT within The ApeFathers NFT collection sold or otherwise transferred to Owner pursuant to this Agreement shall be a “Digital Asset.”
    // The Digital Asset(s) are associated with digital objects (which may include images and/or other digital works) (“Digital Object(s)”).
    // A copy of this contract can be found within the Digital Asset itself, for review by Owner at any time; and enforceable unless voided by the terms therein.
    // The Licensor guarantees the IP to the Digital Objects that were created for The ApeFathers NFT collection have been agreed upon and signed in a seperate contract ("NFT Licensing Agreement") is owned by and paid in full by GSKNNFT Inc, which includes;
    // The IP Agreement formally signed by both parties ("The Artist") and Licensor, who created the traits for compiling the Digital Object(s) through random generation.
        // A copy of the Artist Contract can be found on the Official The ApeFathers NFT website, which can be referenced and reviewed by Owner and Licensor for review at any time; and enforceable unless voided by the terms therein.
    // As detailed below, the Owner may own a Digital Asset, with a full commercial IP license to the Digital Object(s) subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.
    // Purchase of the ApeFathers NFT (the “Main Asset”) may entitle the purchaser to be declared the Owner, and to utilize their specific held asset(s) for their own personal use of the Intellectual Property (“IP”) of ONLY the associated media tied to the Digital Asset on the blockchain.
    // For the avoidance of doubt, the term “Digital Asset(s),” as used herein, includes both the Main Asset and any Digital Objects directly associated with the Main Asset.

    // 1.2. Digital Asset(s).
        // The Digital Asset(s) are subject to copyright and other intellectual property protections, which rights are and shall remain owned by solely the Owner of the individual NFT(s).

    // 1.3. Licenses.
        // Main Asset.
            // Upon a valid transfer of Main Asset to Owner, Licensor hereby grants Owner a limited, transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty free license to use, publish and display the Digital Object(s) associated with the Main Asset during the Term, subject to Owner’s compliance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, including without limitation, any restrictions in Section 1.4 below, solely for the following purposes: 
                // (a) for their own personal, or commercial use; or 
                // (ii) to display the Main Asset for resale.
        // Upon expiration of the Term or breach of any conditions of this Owner Agreement by Owner, all license rights shall immediately terminate.

    // 1.4. License Restrictions.
        // The Digital Asset(s) provided pursuant to this Owner Agreement are licensed, not sold, and Owner receives title to or ownership of the Digital Asset(s) or the intellectual property rights therein.
        // Except for the license expressly set forth herein, no other rights (express or implied) to the Digital Assets(s) are granted. Licensor reserves all rights not expressly granted.
        // Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor grants the User a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the full Commercial IP solely for the purpose of utilizing the Main Asset and any associated Digital Objects held by the Owner on the blockchain.
        // Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Owner shall have the license through this agreement to: 
            // (a) copy, modify, or distribute the Digital Asset(s);
            // (b) use the Digital Asset(s) to advertise, market or sell a product and/or service;
            // (c) incorporate the Digital Asset(s) in videos or other media; or
            // (d) sell merchandise incorporating the Digital Asset(s).
        // Upon a permitted transfer of ownership of the Digital Asset(s) by Owner to a third party, the license to the Digital Assets(s) associated therewith shall be transferable solely subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, including those in Section 6.3, and the Owner’s license to such Digital Assets(s) terminates immediately upon transfer to such third party.
        // Upon transfer of the NFT to a new owner, all ownership and rights to the underlying IP associated with the NFT are also transferred to the new owner, and for the sake of this agreement, the transfer date will be considered the "Effective Date" of the individul, now representative as the "Owner", and subject to any limitations or restrictions explicitly stated in this agreement.
        // Upon a non-permitted transfer of ownership of the Digital Asset(s) by Owner to a third party, the Owner’s license to the Digital Assets(s) associated therewith terminates immediately, and any purported transfer of the license to such Digital Assets(s) to such third party shall be void.
        //  Owner shall not, and shall not permit any third party to, do any of the following:
            // (a) Use the Digital Asset in connection with any illegal activity or for any unlawful purpose;
            // (b) use or publish any modification of the Digital Asset(s) in any way that would be immoral or goes against the standards of practice set out by “The ApeFathers NFT”, and/or GSKNNFT Inc, including without limitation, any link or other reference to license information.
            // (c) Use the Digital Asset in a manner that infringes the rights of any third party, including but not limited to intellectual property rights;
            // (d) Remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright, other legal notices or proprietary notices, metadata legends, symbols, or labels associated with, in or on the Digital Asset(s) or Digital Object(s);
            // (e) Transfer the Digital Asset in violation of any applicable law, including without limitation the securities laws of any jurisdiction;
            // (f) Use the Digital Asset to compete with Licensor or the Business in any way.
        // Failure to comply with the conditions set forth in Sections 1.3 and 1.4 constitutes a material breach.

// 2. IP Rights in the Digital Asset.
    // Except as expressly set forth herein, Owner retains all right, title, and interest in and to any claim to, or use of the commercial intellectual property rights in the Digital Asset(s).
        // The Owner shall not, and shall not permit the use of a third party to;
            // reproduce, distribute, display, or create derivative works based on the IP without the prior written consent of the Owner.
        // Any and all full Intellectual Property rights of the material stated in this contract, belong to the User subject to the terms and conditions, excluding where otherwise stated or provided by the Owner ("GSKNNFT Inc."), will maintain validity as any and all explicitly named here, including;
            // through any future Owner-invoked evolutions (changes as per the Owner's own decision with the proof of such logged as a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain), specifically and exclusively offered by the Owner ("GSKNNFT Inc.") through any mechanism, platform, tool, or method used.
// 3. Replica(s).
    // The Owner understands and agrees that Licensor has no control over, and shall have no liability for, any Replicas.

        // (i) a modification of the Digital Asset(s) made by anyone other than Licensor and/or Owner, unless Licensor or Owner approves such modification in writing;
        // (ii) Owner’s misuse of or misrepresentation regarding the Digital Asset(s); or 
        // (iii) any technology, including without limitation, any Replica or Platform, that fails to perform or ceases to exist.
    // Licensor shall not be obligated to provide any support to Owner or any subsequent owner of the Digital Asset(s).

// 5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNITY.

        // THE LIABILITIES LIMITED BY THIS SECTION 4 APPLY:
            // (a) TO LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE;
            // (b) REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE;
            // (c) EVEN IF LICENSOR IS ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DAMAGES IN QUESTION AND EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE; AND
            // (d) EVEN IF OWNER’S REMEDIES FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
        // If applicable law limits the application of the provisions of this Section 4, Licensor’s liability will be limited to the maximum extent permissible.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```
