 *     @dev Within the world of crossovers there is a special one, where the universes of pokemon,
 *         harry potter and solidity intertwine.
 *         In this crossover a mix creature is created between dumbledore's phoenix, a wild ditto and
 *         since we are in the solidity universe this creature is a contract.
 *         We have called it Phoenixtto and it has two important abilities, that of being reborn from
 *         it's ashes after its destruction and that of copying the behavior of another bytecode
 *         Try to capture the Phoenixtto, if you can...
