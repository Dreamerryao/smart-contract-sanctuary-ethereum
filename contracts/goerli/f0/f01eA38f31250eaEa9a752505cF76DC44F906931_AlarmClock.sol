/**
 * AlarmClock 
 *
 * This contract acts as an event dispatcher by acting like an alarm clock. 
 * The root key holder for a trust will configure an event, and designate
 * a particular point when the "alarm" can go off, firing the event.
 * 
 * Because of the on-chain nature of the alarm, a key-less "challenge"
 * can occur to determine that the clock has past it's alarm point, and
 * will fire the event.
 *
 * Also, much like an alarm, it can be optionally configured to be "snoozed" 
 * by a designated key holder as determined by the root key. In this way,
 * the alarm can be postponed, and any alarm challenges will fail until
 * the new alarm datetime has been reached once more.
 * 
 * The primary design of this alarm and snooze functionality is a 
 * "dead man's switch," in that a root key holder can designate a key
 * to show "proof of life" by signing a transaction that snoozes the alarm
 * for an additional period of time. The theory is that once the key holder
 * is dead (and hasn't shared or distributed their private key), the alarm
 * will no longer snooze and a key-less challenge will fire the event.
 *
 * In combination with a beneficiary getting trustee distribution rights, enables
 * a keyholder to get access to the trust's assets once the trust originator
 * has expired to the ethereal realm.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }

/**
 * TrustEventLog
 *
 * The trust event log acts as a pub/sub service bus
 * for scribes to be able to react to events outside of
 * their own business logic. It enables scribe contracts to compose
 * actions based on a required number of event dependencies.
 * 
 * For instance, a trustee scribe could be optionally dependent
 * on a root key holder's death event before a trustee's
 * distribution rights are enabled.
 *
 * Events are idempotent and can only be fired once. An
 * event hash is registered by the dispatcher. The
 * event hash is generally conceived as a keccak256 hash of an
 * event's metadata. However, dispatchers will want to be careful
 * enough to design their hash scheme such that it is sufficiently
 * difficult to predict or 'attack' the event registry with bogus registrations
 * to block events firing from legitimate configurations. The best
 * way to do this is to take a string in from the key holder at
 * event registration time and use it as a salt. Block height could also
 * work. In either case, there needs to be some non-deterministic
 * element to the event hash or its hash can be predicted and registered
 * in advance of a legitimate use.
 *
 * These event hashes can then be set as event dependencies on scribe enablement,
 * necromancers, or anything else.
 *
 * This further decouples distribution powers from their 
 * enabling events. The scribe that requires an event to be fired
 * doesn't have to be aware of which dispatcher it came from, 
 * but only the dispatcher who has registered for the event hash
 * can fire it.
