* I'm sorry to have to write this post, but I hope I have one last chance before I commit suicide.
* It's a cry for help
================[ To all the good-hearted hackers on the chain ] =====================

After my father left our family, I started working life at a very young age, 
unfortunately I did not get a good education and I cannot do the job I want.

If you can see this message and details here, you can more or less understand what my favorite profession is.

My childhood passed between work and home.
I've never had a friend, I've never had a social life. 
I can't even remember the last time I laughed in my life.
While my peers were living life as it should be, there was a responsibility placed on me. Trying to support a 13-year-old family. Caring for a sick mother and a 2-year-old child

That's part of my story, I haven't been working for a long time now my country is in economic crisis and I'm eating garbage to make a living
I am a beggar, I work in day jobs. I tried this road that was my last hope with the money I got
All my money on the mainnet is $2. The more they try to reach hackers, the less they get.

I reach out to hackers because they have a lot of money. I need $60.000 to save my life

Maybe you want to touch someone's life and save it. As a human being, whether you have a religious belief or not, please listen to your heart.
Connect someone whose last hope is left, who is committing suicide, to life.

If you read this message and took your time, whatever you are, I would like to thank you very much. 
I just want to live...
