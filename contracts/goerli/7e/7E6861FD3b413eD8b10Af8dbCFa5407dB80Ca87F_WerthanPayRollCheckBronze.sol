THERE IS NO CHARGE FOR THE DIGITAL ASSETS; THERE IS A CHARGE FOR THE MINTING FEE FOR THE CREATION OF THE INTELLIGENT CONTRACT YOU PRODUCE.  YOUR PRICE FOR THE DIGITAL ASSET IS ZERO ON THE INITIAL MINTING PROCESS, SO THERE IS NO “COST BASIS” FOR DERIVING A PROFIT.  YOU MAY DONATE TO HELP IN THE PROCESSING OF MORE ART ASSETS.  THE HODLER OF HODL TOKENS AND DIGITAL ASSETS SHALL EXPECT ABSOLUTELY NO RETURNS OF PROFIT OVER THE FREE COST OF THE DIGITAL ASSETS OR THE DONATION, WHICH IS VOLUNTARILY PAID.  HODLER OF HODL TOKENS AND DIGITAL ASSETS SHALL EXPECT ABSOLUTELY NO POSITIVE INTEREST OR ROI (RATE OF INTEREST OR RETURN ON PRINCIPLE).  YOU KNOW, AGREE, AND ARE AWARE THAT THE DIGITAL ASSETS MAY NOT BE CAPABLE OF BEING SOLD, TRADED, OR EXCHANGED TO OR FROM ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY.  THIS MEANS YOU MAY OWN IT AND NOT BE ABLE TO EXTRACT FUNDS BY SALE, TRADE, OR EXCHANGE.  SHOULD YOU PAY THE MINT FEE OR DONATE AND USE CRYPTO OR FIAT MONEY (THE “DEBT PAPER”) IT IS RISKY AND CAN AND WILL BE LOST.

HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT OFFER AN INVESTMENT CONTRACT, STOCKS, BONDS, DERIVATIVES, AND TRANSFERRABLE SHARES BECAUSE HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT OFFER A RATE OF RETURN OR A PROFIT OTHER THAN DIRECT OWNERSHIP OF HODL TOKEN AND DIGITAL ASSETS.

HODL PROTOCOL IS NOT OFFERING TO MARKET THE DIGITAL ASSETS FOR YOU; HODL PROTOCOL IS NOT MANAGING THEM FOR YOU.  THE HOLDLERS OF THE HODL TOKEN MANAGE THE HODL PROTOCOL. HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT OFFER MANAGERIAL EXPERTISE OR ESSENTIAL MANAGERIAL EFFORTS THAT AFFECT THE SUCCESS OF DIGITAL ASSETS; HODL PROTOCOL IS NOT OFFERED TO SELL OR RESALE, OR DISTRIBUTE DIGITAL ASSETS; HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT HAVE HIDDEN, ABSENT, UNDISCLOSED PROCESSES OF SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION ASYMMETRIES BETWEEN THE MANAGERS AND PROMOTERS (AGAIN THERE ARE NOT ANY MANAGERS AND PROMOTERS), HODL PROTOCOL PROMISES NONE.  HODL PROTOCOL OFFERS NO INVESTORS AND PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS.  ALL PARTICIPANTS ARE FULLY DISCLOSED IN THE BLOCKCHAIN AS ITS FUNCTION, WHICH IS 100% HONEST, TRACKABLE, AND RELIABLE.  IT'S OPEN FOR EVERYONE TO SEE.  I AGREE I AM NOT AN INDIVIDUAL(S), ENTITY(S), CITIZEN(S), RESIDENT, OR RESIDENT NATIONAL(S), HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS A “DIGITAL ASSETS CREATOR/PRODUCER,” LIVING OR LOCATED WITHIN THE COUNTRY BORDERS OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (USA), CANADA, MALAYSIA, SINGAPORE, MALTA, CUBA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA, SUDAN, SYRIA, VENEZUELA, CRIMEA REGION, BANGLADESH, BOLIVIA, ECUADOR, KYRGYZSTAN, HONG KONG, CHINA, UNITED KINGDOM (RETAIL USERS ONLY), NETHERLANDS, GERMANY, FRANCE, LITHUANIA, ITALY, JAPAN, AND BRAZIL (COLLECTIVELY THE “RESTRICTED COUNTRIES”).   AN INDIVIDUAL(S), ENTITY(S), CITIZEN(S), RESIDENT, OR RESIDENT NATIONAL(S) LIVING IN A RESTRICTED COUNTRIES IS A RESTRICTED AND SHALL BE KNOWN AS A RESTRICTED PERSON (THE “RESTRICTED PERSON(S)”). AS A RESTRICTED PERSON LIVING WITHIN A RESTRICTED COUNTRIES, YOU SHALL REFRAIN FROM MINTING DIGITAL ASSETS.   A DIGITAL ASSETS CREATOR/PRODUCER LIVING OR RESIDING OUTSIDE THE BORDERS OF THE RESTRICTED COUNTRIES IS AN UNRESTRICTED PERSON (THE “UNRESTRICTED PERSON(S)”).  HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT SUPPORT OR CONDONE THE CREATION, BUYING, OR SELLING OF DIGITAL ASSETS (S) AS A MEANS OF INVESTMENT.  BLOCKCHAINS, SMART CONTRACTS, FUNGIBLE TOKENS, NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS, AND CRYPTOCURRENCIES, IN GENERAL, ARE ALL CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES, AND AS SUCH, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF TOTAL FAILURE. COMPUTERS ARE COMPLEX, AND DISTRIBUTED LEDGERS, SOFTWARE, PROGRAMS, AND CODING ARE COMPLEX. HODL PROTOCOL PROVIDES A GATEWAY AND INTERFACES TO INTERACT WITH ART ASSETS IN THE FORM OF INTELLIGENT CONTRACTS DECENTRALIZED AND DEPLOYED ON THE ETHEREUM MAINNET FROM UNRESTRICTED COUNTRIES ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE WITH ACCESS TO THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN.  ADDITIONALLY, AS MENTIONED BEFORE, THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS AND SERVERS ARE LOCATED IN AN UNRESTRICTED COUNTRY.    HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT PROVIDE OR CONTROL LIQUIDITY OTHER THAN THE PORTION ALLOCATED WHEN THE HODL PROTOCOL WAS CREATED. HODL PROTOCOL CAUTIONS ALL USERS AND HODLERS TO EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN PURCHASING HODL TOKENS AS LIQUIDITY MAY FLUCTUATE OR BE NON-EXISTENT AND WHEN MINTING DIGITAL ASSETS BECAUSE THERE MAY NOT BE A MARKET FOR THEM AT ALL.   WHEN YOU CREATE, MINT, BUY, SELL, OR TRANSFER ANY DIGITAL ASSETS, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR TRANSACTION DECISIONS.  HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT CENTRALLY STORE, HOST, DISTRIBUTE, AGGREGATE, SELL, CUSTODY, OR MANAGE YOUR DIGITAL ASSETS.  THE HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT STORE THE METADATA FOR YOU OR CREATE LIQUIDITY POOLS AT THIS TIME AND MAY NEVER. THE HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT HAVE AUTOMATED MARKET MAKERS OR TRADING MARKETS FOR DIGITAL ASSETS.   CAUTION: ALL OPINIONS AND INFORMATION SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THAT HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT DIRECTLY CONTROL ARE THOSE RESPECTIVE INDIVIDUALS ALONE, AND COMMENTS BY OTHERS SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON TO MAKE YOUR DECISION TO MINT DIGITAL ASSETS THROUGH THE HODL PROTOCOL.  YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON ANY ADVICE FROM ANYONE TO GET INVOLVED WITH THE HODL PROTOCOL AND ITS DIGITAL ASSETS; YOU WILL MORE THAN LIKELY LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY.  DO NOT RELY UPON HODL PROTOCOL FOR FINANCIAL, INVESTMENT, TAX, OR LEGAL ADVICE.  DO NOT RELY UPON ANY THIRD-PARTY DISCUSSING HODL PROTOCOL FOR FINANCIAL, INVESTMENT, TAX, OR LEGAL ADVICE.   ADDITIONALLY, HODL PROTOCOL CAN CONTROL WHAT IT PROMISES BASED ON THE TIMELINE AND PHASES, BUT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, GOVERN, OR MAINTAIN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FOLLOWING:
     
    WHO CAN PARTICIPATE AND PRODUCE DIGITAL ASSETS,

    WHICH DIGITAL ASSETS ARE MINTED USING THE HODL PROTOCOL,

    THE DONATION VALUE YOU PLACE ON THE DIGITAL ASSETS,

    THE FUTURE VALUE OF DIGITAL ASSETS,

    THE INTERMEDIARY PLATFORMS, OR NETWORKS, THROUGH WHICH THE BLOCKCHAIN
    FUNCTIONS INCLUDE HOW THE DIGITAL ASSETS ARE TO BE TRANSFERRED, PURCHASED, OR SOLD.  THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND MARKETPLACES AND USING YOUR WALLET, 

    THE METHODS AND MANNER IN WHICH THE HODLERS TRANSFER OR MANAGE THEIR DIGITAL ASSETS, 

    THE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM ANY OF THE ACTIVITIES AND DECISIONS LISTED ABOVE,

    IF THE USERS OR HODLERS ARE LOCATED IN RESTRICTED COUNTRIES AND UNRESTRICTED COUNTRIES,
     
    BY PARTICIPATING AND MINTING YOUR DIGITAL ASSETS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE, AGREE, AND ACCEPT ALL CONDITIONAL AGREEMENTS IN THIS DISCLAIMER AND ADDITIONALLY THE FOLLOWING: 

    YOU MUST NOT EXPECT A PROFIT FROM THE WORK OF OTHERS; THIS IS NOT A JOINT OR COMMON ENTERPRISE,

    DIGITAL ASSETS MAY FLUCTUATE IN VALUE IN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS,

    THE DIGITAL ASSETS SUPPLIES MAY GO UP OR DOWN IN VALUE IF THEY HAVE ANY VALUE AT ALL, AND YOU ARE NOT GUARANTEED, NOR SHOULD YOU EXPECT, ANY NET VALUE APPRECIATION OF THE UNDERLYING DIGITAL ASSETS AS A COLLECTIBLE OR BUSINESS MODEL, AND THERE ARE NO PROTECTIONS AGAINST LOSS IN VALUE,

    THE PAST PRICE AND PURCHASING ACTIVITY TRENDS ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE TRENDS AND ARE NOT A PROXY FOR THE HISTORICAL OR PROJECTED FUTURE VALUE OF ANY SPECIFIC DIGITAL ASSETS,

    AS A USER, YOU GENERATE YOUR KEYS AND HOLD YOUR WALLET,

    YOU MINT YOUR INTELLIGENT CONTRACT AS A DIGITAL ASSET; THE HODL PROTOCOL IS JUST PROVIDING YOU A MECHANISM, AS A SERVICE, TO ASSIST YOU IN DOING SO, AND THIS IS WHAT THE MINT FEE IS FOR.  THE MORE COMPLEX THE INTELLIGENT CONTRACT, THE MORE IT COSTS,

    THERE IS NO INVESTMENT OF MONEY,

    THERE IS NO ORDINARY OR COMMON ENTERPRISE,

    ANY AIRDROPS DISBURSED TO HODLERS FOR THEIR MEMBERSHIP LEVEL ARE ACCESSIBLE.
     
    DIGITAL ASSETS ARE NOT:

    CURRENCY, LEGAL TENDER, OR MONEY, 

    AN INVESTMENT (WHETHER SECURED OR UNSECURED), EQUITY INTEREST, PROPRIETARY INTEREST, OR ECONOMIC RIGHT,

    EQUITY, DEBT OR HYBRID INSTRUMENT, SECURITY COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT SCHEME, 

    A MANAGED FUND, FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE, FUTURES CONTRACT, DEPOSIT, COMMERCIAL PAPER, NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT, INVESTMENT CONTRACT, SHARES, NOTE, BOND, WARRANT, CERTIFICATE, OR INSTRUMENT ENTITLING THE HODLER TO INTEREST WHATSOEVER, DIVIDENDS OR ANY RETURN, NOR ANY OTHER FINANCIAL DEVICE OR SECURITY,

    DIGITAL ASSETS ARE NOT GUARANTEED OR SECURED BY ANY PERSON, ASSET, OR ENTITY. YOU MUST HAVE NO EXPECTATION OF PROFIT FROM THE WORK OF OTHERS; THERE IS NO JOINT EFFORT OR COMMON ENTERPRISE CREATED TO CREATE A PAYMENT, RENT, OR PROFIT.  THIS MEANS THERE IS NO TYPICAL JOINT OR COMMON ENTERPRISE; THERE SHALL BE NO EXPECTATION OF EFFORTS OF A PROMOTER OR THIRD PARTY FOR YOU TO MAKE ANY FORM OF FINANCIAL GAIN FROM HODL PROTOCOL AND ITS HODL TOKEN,

    HODL PROTOCOL IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO ISSUE DIGITAL ASSETS AS A REPLACEMENT FOR ANY THAT MAY BE LOST, STOLEN, DESTROYED, OR OTHERWISE INACCESSIBLE FOR ANY REASON.
     
    TO RECAP A CRITICAL POINT, YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THAT HODL PROTOCOL IS NOT OFFERING A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PROFITS TO YOU OR OTHERS AND THE DERIVED EFFORTS OF OTHERS, WHETHER THE PUBLIC, HODLERS OF DIGITAL ASSETS, OR HODLERS OF HODL TOKENS.   ALSO, INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PUBLIC AND UNRELATED TO THE HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT CONTROL THE EXPECTATION OF PROFITS.  HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT PREVENT THE PUBLIC AND THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF THE HODL TOKEN OR DIGITAL ASSETS.   HODL PROTOCOL IS NOT OFFERING THE SALE OF ANYTHING; YOU ARE CREATING YOUR DIGITAL ASSETS LIKE CREATING THE SEED, PLANTING IT IN THE GROUND, WATERING IT, AND WATCHING IT GROW – YOU CAN KEEP IT FOR YOURSELF, OR YOU CAN CONVEY IT USING THE BLOCKCHAIN (SEE DEFINITION “BIRTH” ABOVE).  HODL PROTOCOL IS NOT MANAGING OR PROMOTING ANYTHING OR OFFERING THE EXPECTATION OF PROFITS BASED ON OUR ACTIONS, YOUR ACTIONS, OR OTHERS.  YOU BIRTH THE DIGITAL ASSETS, CREATE THEM, AND OWN THEM UNTIL YOU CONVEY IT.  AGAIN, THE HODL PROTOCOL IS NOT SELLING A DIGITAL ASSET BECAUSE THE DIGITAL SUPPORT IS NOT PURCHASABLE.  YOU COMPLETE IT BY PAYING A MINT FEE FOR OUR SERVICE; THIS SERVICE ASSISTS YOU IN WRITING THE INTELLIGENT CONTRACT TO CREATE THE DIGITAL ASSETS.  AS YOU BIRTH THE DIGITAL ASSETS, YOU OWN A PIECE OF THE ART OBJECT AS A FORM OF A CERTIFICATE OF TITLE OWNERSHIP AS AN FTO INTELLIGENT CONTRACT(S) (SEE DEFINITIONS), AND YOU RECEIVE PART OF THE ROYALTY IF YOU CREATE A CTO INTELLIGENT CONTRACT(S) (SEE DEFINITIONS).  HODL PROTOCOL CHARGES A MINT FEE FOR HELPING YOU MINT YOUR DIGITAL ASSETS, AND HODL PROTOCOL GIVES YOU BENEFITS THAT ARE EQUAL TO AND GREATER THAN THE VALUE OF THE COST OF THE MINT FEE (SEE BENEFITS).  ADDITIONALLY, YOU CAN PURCHASE DIGITAL IMAGES IN THE FORM OF A REGULAR NON-FUNGIBLE TOKEN SHOULD YOU PREFER TO DO THAT; THESE HAVE NO BENEFITS.    HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT CENTRALLY STORE, HOST, DISTRIBUTE, AGGREGATE, SELL, CUSTODY, OR MANAGE YOUR DIGITAL ASSETS.  THE HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT STORE THE METADATA FOR YOU OR CREATE LIQUIDITY POOLS AT THIS TIME AND MAY NEVER. THE HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT HAVE AUTOMATED MARKET MAKERS OR TRADING MARKETS FOR DIGITAL ASSETS.   CAUTION: ALL OPINIONS AND INFORMATION SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THAT HODL PROTOCOL DOES NOT DIRECTLY CONTROL ARE THOSE RESPECTIVE INDIVIDUALS ALONE, AND COMMENTS BY OTHERS SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON TO MAKE YOUR DECISION TO MINT DIGITAL ASSETS THROUGH THE HODL PROTOCOL.  YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON ANY ADVICE FROM ANYONE TO GET INVOLVED WITH THE HODL PROTOCOL AND ITS DIGITAL ASSETS; YOU WILL MORE THAN LIKELY LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY.  DO NOT RELY UPON HODL PROTOCOL FOR FINANCIAL, INVESTMENT, TAX, OR LEGAL ADVICE.  DO NOT RELY UPON ANY THIRD-PARTY DISCUSSING HODL PROTOCOL FOR FINANCIAL, INVESTMENT, TAX, OR LEGAL ADVICE.   ADDITIONALLY, HODL PROTOCOL CAN CONTROL WHAT IT PROMISES BASED ON THE TIMELINE AND PHASES, BUT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, GOVERN, OR MAINTAIN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FOLLOWING:
