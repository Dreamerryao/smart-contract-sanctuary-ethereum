// OWNER ACKNOWLEDGES RECEIPT AND UNDERSTANDING OF THIS OWNER AGREEMENT, AND AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS.
// OWNER’S ACCEPTANCE OF A DIGITAL ASSET SHALL BE DEEMED ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AND CONSENT TO BE GOVERNED THEREBY.
// IF THE OWNER DOES NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, THIS LICENSE AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATES.

// In consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

// 1. LICENSES & RESTRICTIONS.
    // 1.1 NFT. These “NFTs” are defined as non-fungible tokens.
    // Ownership of which this specific collection is registered on the ethereum blockchain as;
        // Name: “The ApeFathers NFT” (the “Business”) - the NFT "project" operations, employees, agents, representatives and subcontractors,
        // Token Tracker: “DAPES” (the “Token”) - the tracker ID for the Digital Assets on the ethereum blockchain,
        // Contract: “ApeFathers.sol” (the “NFT Contract”) - this specific contract deployed on the ethereum blockchain,
        // Artist: "Tahliazr" (the "Artist") - designed and created the traits conceptualized by GSKNNFT Inc., and furthermore signed the contract ("NFT Licensing Agreement") to transfer the Licenses of the traits created by their ("The Artist's") own hand,
        // Artist Contract: ("NFT Licensing Agreement") - Contract for the transfer of original Intellectual Property of the individual trait images created by The Artist and formally signed by both parties (The Artist and GSKNNFT Inc.),
        // Created by: (“Licensor”) - Gordon Skinner of GSKNNFT Inc. ("@GSKNNFT", "gsknnft.eth", "[email protected]").

// For the case of this NFT Owner Agreement; any NFT within The ApeFathers NFT collection sold or otherwise transferred to Owner pursuant to this Agreement shall be a “Digital Asset.”
// The Digital Asset(s) are associated with digital objects (which may include images and/or other digital works) (“Digital Object(s)”).
// A copy of this contract can be found within the Digital Asset itself, for review by Owner at any time; and enforceable unless voided by the terms therein.
// The Licensor guarantees the IP to the Digital Objects that were created for The ApeFathers NFT collection have been agreed upon and signed in a seperate contract ("NFT Licensing Agreement") is owned by and paid in full by GSKNNFT Inc, which includes;

// As detailed below, the Owner may own a Digital Asset, with a full commercial IP license to the Digital Object(s) subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.
// Purchase of the ApeFathers NFT (the “Main Asset”) may entitle the purchaser to be declared the Owner, and to utilize their specific held asset(s) for their own personal use of the Intellectual Property (“IP”) of ONLY the associated media tied to the Digital Asset on the blockchain.
// For the avoidance of doubt, the term “Digital Asset(s),” as used herein, includes both the Main Asset and any Digital Objects directly associated with the Main Asset.

    // 1.2. Digital Asset(s).
        // The Digital Asset(s) are subject to copyright and other intellectual property protections, which rights are and shall remain owned by solely the Owner of the individual NFT(s).

    // 1.3. Licenses.
        // Main Asset.
            // Upon a valid transfer of Main Asset to Owner, Licensor hereby grants Owner a limited, transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty free license to use, publish and display the Digital Object(s) associated with the Main Asset during the Term, subject to Owner’s compliance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, including without limitation, any restrictions in Section 1.4 below, solely for the following purposes: 
                // (a) for their own personal, or commercial use; or 
                // (ii) to display the Main Asset for resale.
        // Upon expiration of the Term or breach of any conditions of this Owner Agreement by Owner, all license rights shall immediately terminate.

    // 1.4. License Restrictions.
        // The Digital Asset(s) provided pursuant to this Owner Agreement are licensed, not sold, and Owner receives title to or ownership of the Digital Asset(s) or the intellectual property rights therein.
        // Except for the license expressly set forth herein, no other rights (express or implied) to the Digital Assets(s) are granted. Licensor reserves all rights not expressly granted.
        // Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Owner shall have the license through this agreement to: 
            // (a) copy, modify, or distribute the Digital Asset(s);
            // (b) use the Digital Asset(s) to advertise, market or sell a product and/or service;
            // (c) incorporate the Digital Asset(s) in videos or other media; or
            // (d) sell merchandise incorporating the Digital Asset(s).
        // Upon a permitted transfer of ownership of the Digital Asset(s) by Owner to a third party, the license to the Digital Assets(s) associated therewith shall be transferable solely subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, including those in Section 6.3, and the Owner’s license to such Digital Assets(s) terminates immediately upon transfer to such third party. 
        // Upon a non-permitted transfer of ownership of the Digital Asset(s) by Owner to a third party, the Owner’s license to the Digital Assets(s) associated therewith terminates immediately, and any purported transfer of the license to such Digital Assets(s) to such third party shall be void.
            // Owner agrees not to:
                // (a) remove any copyright or other legal notices associated with the Digital Asset(s) or Digital Object(s);
                // (b) remove or alter any metadata of the Digital Asset(s); or 
                // (c) use or publish any modification of the Digital Asset(s) in any way that would be immoral or goes against the standards of practice set out by “The ApeFathers NFT”, and/or GSKNNFT Inc, including without limitation, any link or other reference to license information.
        // Failure to comply with the conditions set forth in Sections 1.3 and 1.4 constitutes a material breach.

// 2. IP Rights in the Digital Asset.
    // Except as expressly set forth herein, Owner retains all right, title, and interest in and to any claim to, or use of the commercial intellectual property rights in the Digital Asset(s).
    // Any and all Intellectual Property rights, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein for the Digital Object(s), will maintain validity as any and all Digital Object(s) explicitly named here, including through any future Owner-invoked evolutions(changes in the Digital Media as per the Owner's own decision with the proof of such logged as a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain), specifically and exclusively offered by "The ApeFathers NFT" through any mechanism, platform, tool, or method used to perform such evolution.

// 3. Replica(s).
    // The Owner understands and agrees that Licensor has no control over, and shall have no liability for, any Replicas.
    // Owner understands and agrees that the Platforms and/or any Replica(s) may be unavailable or cease to exist at any time.

// 4. Disclaimer.
    // LICENSOR MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF NONINFRINGEMENT.

    // Owner understands and accepts the risks of blockchain technology.
    // Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensor does not warrant that the Digital Asset(s) will perform without error.
    // Further, Licensor provides no warranty regarding, and will have no responsibility for, any claim arising out of:
        // (i) a modification of the Digital Asset(s) made by anyone other than Licensor and/or Owner, unless Licensor or Owner approves such modification in writing;
        // (ii) Owner’s misuse of or misrepresentation regarding the Digital Asset(s); or 
        // (iii) any technology, including without limitation, any Replica or Platform, that fails to perform or ceases to exist.
    // Licensor shall not be obligated to provide any support to Owner or any subsequent owner of the Digital Asset(s).

// 5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNITY.

        // LICENSOR’S CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS OWNER AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OWNER(S) PAID THE LICENSOR FOR DIGITAL ASSET(S).
    // 5.2. Excluded Damages. 
        // IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OR FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS OWNER AGREEMENT.

        // THE LIABILITIES LIMITED BY THIS SECTION 4 APPLY:
            // (a) TO LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE;
            // (b) REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE;
            // (c) EVEN IF LICENSOR IS ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DAMAGES IN QUESTION AND EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE; AND
            // (d) EVEN IF OWNER’S REMEDIES FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
        // If applicable law limits the application of the provisions of this Section 4, Licensor’s liability will be limited to the maximum extent permissible.
        // For the avoidance of doubt, Licensor’s liability limits and other rights set forth in this Section 4 apply likewise to Licensor’s affiliates, licensors, suppliers, advertisers, agents, sponsors, directors, officers, employees, consultants, and other representatives.
    // 5.4. Indemnity.
        // Owner will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensors and its affiliates, and any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, contractors, and agents (“Licensor Indemnitees”) from and against any and all claims, causes of action, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal costs, which shall be reimbursed as incurred) arising out of, related to, or alleging Owner’s breach of any provision in this agreement, including but not limited to Owner’s failure to comply with the licensing conditions set forth in Section 1.

// 6. Term & Termination.
    // 6.1. Term.
        // This Owner Agreement shall continue until terminated pursuant to Subsection 6.2 or 6.3 below (the “Term”).
    // 6.2. Termination for Transfer.
        // The license granted in Section 1 above applies only to the extent that Owner continues to possess the applicable Digital Asset.
        // If at any time the Owner sells, trades, donates, gives away, transfers, or otherwise disposes of a Digital Asset for any reason, this Owner Agreement, including without limitation, the license rights granted to Owner in Section 1 will immediately terminate, with respect to such Digital Asset, without the requirement of notice, and Owner will have no further rights in or to such Digital Asset or Digital Object(s) associated therewith.
    // 6.3. Termination for Cause.
        // Licensor may terminate this Owner Agreement for Owner’s material breach by written notice specifying in detail the nature of the breach, effective in thirty (30) days unless the Owner first cures such breach, or effective immediately if the breach is not subject to cure.
    // 6.4. Effects of Termination.
        // Upon termination of this Owner Agreement, Owner shall cease all use of the Digital Object(s) and delete, destroy, or return all copies of the Digital Object(s) in its possession or control.
        // Any provision of this Owner Agreement that must survive to fulfill its essential purpose will survive termination or expiration.

// 7. MISCELLANEOUS.
    // 7.1. Independent Contractors.
        // The parties are independent contractors and shall so represent themselves in all regards.
        // Neither party is the agent of the other, and neither may make commitments on the other’s behalf.
    // 7.2. Force Majeure.
        // No delay, failure, or default, other than a failure to pay fees when due, will constitute a breach of this Owner Agreement to the extent caused by acts of;
            // war, terrorism, hurricanes, earthquakes, epidemics, other acts of God or of nature, strikes or other labor disputes, riots or other acts of civil disorder, embargoes, government orders responding to any of the foregoing, or other causes beyond the performing party’s reasonable control.
    // 7.3. Assignment & Successors. 
        // Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth herein, including in Sections 1.4 and this Section 6.3, Owner may transfer ownership of the Digital Asset(s) to a third-party, provided that Owner:
            // (i) has not breached this Owner Agreement prior to the transfer;
            // (ii) notifies such third party that Licensor shall receive a royalty equal of up to 10% of the purchase price for any sale of a Digital Asset by such third-party; and
            // (iii) Owner ensures that such third party is made aware of this Owner Agreement and agrees to be bound by the obligations and restrictions set forth herein.
        // If the third party does not agree to be bound by the obligations and restrictions set forth herein, then the licenses granted herein shall terminate.
        // In no case shall any of the license rights or other rights granted herein be transferrable apart from ownership of the Digital Asset.
        // Except to the extent forbidden in this Section 6.3, this Owner Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties’ respective successors and assigns.
        // Any purported assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 6.3, including the transfer restriction in Section 1.4, shall be void.
        // Only a single entity may own each entire Digital Asset at any time, with the exclusion of fractionalization ownership, and only the entities previously named shall have a license to the Digital Object(s) associated therewith.
        // Owner may fractionalize the use of Digital Asset, but ownership is never forfeited.        
        // In the case of fractionalized ownership, the owner with the majority fractionalized portions of the Digital Asset(s) retains the Intellectual Property and any rights and limitations as stated by this agreement shall be considered valid and in force.
        // Upon transfer of a Digital Asset from a first user to a second user, the license to the first user for the Digital Object(s) associated with such Digital Asset shall immediately terminate.

    // 7.4. Severability.
        // To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties hereby waive any provision of law that would render any clause of this Owner Agreement invalid or otherwise unenforceable in any respect.
        // In the event that a provision of this Owner Agreement is held to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, such provision will be interpreted to fulfill its intended purpose to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and the remaining provisions of this Owner Agreement will continue in full force and effect.
    // 7.5. No Waiver.
        // Neither party will be deemed to have waived any of its rights under this Owner Agreement by lapse of time or by any statement or representation other than by an authorized representative in an explicit written waiver.
        // No waiver of a breach of this Owner Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other breach of this Owner Agreement.
    // 7.6. Choice of Law & Jurisdiction:
        // This Owner Agreement is governed by Canadian law, or any federal, provincial, or state law where the Licensor (GSKNNFT INC.) is located and conducts their business in the future, and both parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial and federal courts located in Canada or any federal jurisdiction as per the location of the Licensor, and waive any right to challenge personal jurisdiction or venue.
    // 7.7. Entire Agreement.
