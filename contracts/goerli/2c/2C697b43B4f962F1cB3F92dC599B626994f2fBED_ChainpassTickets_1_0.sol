/*
 *  ChainpassTickets V1.0
 *
 *  The base ERC-721 contract representing tickets to a Chainpass event.  Similar to launching events,
 *  tickets can only be issued via the Chainpass platform, and os the issue tickets methods can only
 *  be called by the Chainpass wallet.
 *
 *  Since this contract acts as a base contract with which a non-upgradeable proxy contract will be
 *  pointing at, we use the OZ Initializable standard.
 *
 *  On issuing tickets, we mint NFT's immediately upfront and assign the owner to be this event's
 *  splitting contract.  The ERC721iEnumerable parent contract is a perfect implementation since it
 *  allows for batch minting at O(1) gas cost.
 *
 *  ChainpassTickets integrate natively with the ChainpassMarketplace contract to make buying and selling
 *  as easy as possible.  Upon initialization, the ChainpassMarketplace is made an approved operator for
 *  ChainpassTickets.  The listTickets() method is a helper for approving the ChainpassMarketplace as an operator 
 *  and listing a holder's tickets for sale on the marketplace.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
