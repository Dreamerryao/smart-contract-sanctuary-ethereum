 * Original can be found also deployed on https://etherscan.io/address/0xCD18eAa163733Da39c232722cBC4E8940b1D8888
 * Modifications:
 * - Sablier "pulls" the funds from the creator of the stream at creation. In the Aave case, we already have the funds.
 * - Anybody can create streams on Sablier. Here, only the funds admin (Aave governance via controller) can
 * - Adapted codebase to Solidity 0.8.11, mainly removing SafeMath and CarefulMath to use native safe math
 * - Same as with creation, on Sablier the `sender` and `recipient` can cancel a stream. Here, only fund admin and recipient

 *
 * To avoid https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector

 * https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/[transparent proxy pattern]. This pattern implies two

 *
 * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if
 * that call matches one of the admin functions exposed by the proxy itself.
 * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the
 * implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says
 * "admin cannot fallback to proxy target".
 *
 * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing
 * the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due
 * to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation.
