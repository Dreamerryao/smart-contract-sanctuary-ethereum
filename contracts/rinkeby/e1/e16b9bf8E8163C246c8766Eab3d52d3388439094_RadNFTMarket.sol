/**
 * @title RAD NFT Market
 *
 * @notice A RAD non-fungible token market contract that includes the following functionality:
 *
 *  - A NFT owner can put a NFT up for sale in this market at the desired price in Wei. (A NFT must be allowed to move
 *    for this contract by either `approve` or `setApprovalForAll` (ERC721)).
 *  - All NFTs added for sale are listed. The complete list can be obtained by calling `getTokenList` function. It is
 *    possible to use `tokenMarketIDs` mapping to check for the presence of a specific NFT.
 *  - A NFT owner can set a new price with `setPrice` and refund his NFT by calling `refund` function.
 *  - A user can purchase the listed NFTs. If a user has sent more ETH than necessary for purchasing, the balance more
 *    than `DUST` will be refunded.
 *
 * @dev Warning. This contract is not intended for inheritance. In case of inheritance, it is recommended to change
 * the access of all storage variables, except `DUST`, from public to private in order to avoid violating
 * the integrity of the storage. In addition, you will need to add functions for them to get values.
