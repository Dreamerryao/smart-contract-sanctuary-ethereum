UniV3NFTERC20Mapper

Given an Uni v3 pool nft -> generate ERC20 for locking the pos nft

A UNIv3ToERC20 tokenID to address mapping keeps track of all tokenIDs associated with ERC20s
The related ERC20 address is generated from the name of the token pool and checked for existence

Whereas G-uni pools use the `uniswapV3MintCallback` requiring the pool to be created via their contracts
This contract will let user created uni v3 pools be mapped to ERC20
Guni: https://etherscan.io/address/0xf517263181e468fa958050cd6abfb58a445772ce#code

Flow:

- On deposit, the NFT position needs to be transfered to this contract
- This will trigger a onERC721Received fn
- We accept the deposit and keep an account using _staketoken
- Create a user info object, with the stake info
- We generate a custom name for the ERC20 token to mint, using the pool0 and pool1 info from the nft
- Use secondsPerLiquidityInsideInitialX128 to create an initial snapshot of erc20 tokens to mint
- If the erc20 token already exists, we mint secondsPerLiquidityInsideInitialX128 amount to the user
- Otherwise we create it 


- On unstake, we transfer `amountMinted` from user to the contract for the ERC20 associated with the NFT tokenID
- We burn the ERC20
- We update accounting
- Transfer the nft back to the user

- Since secondsPerLiquidityInsideInitialX128 increases over time, a user who creates a LP a long time before trigerring this contract will get more ERC20 tokens
- A user can come back and call mintForUser to update accounting and get any new;y deserved tokens
