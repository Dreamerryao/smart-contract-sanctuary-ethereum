 * @title Ofm (OFM) ERC20 token
 *
 * @notice Ofm is a core ERC20 token powering Ocean Floor Music echosystem.
 *      It is tradable on exchanges,
 *      it powers up the governance protocol (Ofm DAO) and participates in Yield Farming.
 *
 * @dev Token Summary:
 *      - Symbol: $OFM
 *      - Name: Ocean Floor Music
 *      - Decimals: 18
 *      - Initial token supply: 35,000,000 $OFM
 *      - Maximum final token supply: 50,000,000 OFM
 *          - Up to 15,000,000 OFM may get minted in 3 years period via yield farming
 *      - Mintable: total supply may increase
 *      - Burnable: total supply may decrease
 *
 * @dev Token balances and total supply are effectively 192 bits long, meaning that maximum
 *      possible total supply smart contract is able to track is 2^192 (close to 10^40 tokens)
 *
 * @dev Smart contract doesn't use safe math. All arithmetic operations are overflow/underflow safe.
 *      Additionally, Solidity 0.8.1 enforces overflow/underflow safety.
 *
 * @dev ERC20: reviewed according to https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20
 *
 * @dev ERC20: contract has passed OpenZeppelin ERC20 tests,
 *      see https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/test/token/ERC20/ERC20.behavior.js
 *      see https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/test/token/ERC20/ERC20.test.js
 *      see adopted copies of these tests in the `test` folder
 *
 * @dev ERC223/ERC777: not supported;
 *      send tokens via `safeTransferFrom` and implement `ERC20Receiver.onERC20Received` on the receiver instead

   * @notice Determines the permission bitmask an operator can set on the

   * @notice Used to calculate the permission bitmask to be set when requested
   *     in `updateRole` and `updateFeatures` functions
   *
   * @dev Calculated based on:
   *      1) operator's own permission set read from userRoles[operator]
   *      2) target permission set - what is already set on the target
   *      3) desired permission set - what do we want set target to
   *
   * @dev Corner cases:
   *      1) Operator is super admin and its permission set is `FULL_PRIVILEGES_MASK`:
   *        `desired` bitset is returned regardless of the `target` permission set value
   *        (what operator sets is what they get)
   *      2) Operator with no permissions (zero bitset):
   *        `target` bitset is returned regardless of the `desired` value
   *        (operator has no authority and cannot modify anything)
   *
   * @dev Example:
   *      Consider an operator with the permissions bitmask     00001111
   *      is about to modify the target permission set          01010101
   *      Operator wants to set that permission set to          00110011
   *      Based on their role, an operator has the permissions
   *      to update only lowest 4 bits on the target, meaning that
   *      high 4 bits of the target set in this example is left
   *      unchanged and low 4 bits get changed as desired:      01010011
   *
   * @param operator address of the contract operator which is about to set the permissions
   * @param target input set of permissions to operator is going to modify
   * @param desired desired set of permissions operator would like to set
   * @return resulting set of permissions given operator will set

 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884[EIP1884] increases the gas cost
