/**
 * @title {ICheckout} allows checkouts using either the native cryptocurrency (ex: ETH for Ethereum) or
 * ERC20 tokens (ex: USDC, WETH, WBTC...) to pay for an order.
 * 
 * It works as follows:
 * 
 * 1. A user starts the checkout process off-chain from a storefront and is ready to pay using the native currency 
 *    or one of the ERC20 tokens that are accepted for payment.
 * 
 * 2. Upon receiving the order request, the backend service of the storefront checks if the order can be placed
 *    (ex: the requested asset is still available).
 * 
 * 3. If the order can be placed, the back-end service generates a signature containing the following information:
 *      - the address of the appropriate checkout contract.
 *      - the id (which is a unique identifier for what is being ordered).
 *      - the address of the ERC20 token used for payment, or address(0) if the native currency is used.
 *      - the payment value.
 *      - an expiration timestamp for that particular order, after which it cannot be completed.
 * 
 * 4. The backend sends that message to the front-end checkout process along with a corresponding signature
 * 
 * 5. On the front end, the user is prompted to first approve the appropriate token allowwance to {CourtyardCheckout}, and
 *    then to sign the order transaction against {CourtyardCheckout}.
 * 
 * 6. If everything is in order (including the requested asset was not purchased by someone else in the meantime), the
 *    transaction will succeed and the attached order book (see {IOrderBook}) will record it and emit an event to
 *    notify off-chain processes that an order was just placed so they can behave accordingly.
 * 
 * 7. The user now has a successful transaction hash that is a "proof of payment" that can be used to retrieve the 
 *    full transaction result on a block explorer, containing all the information relevant to the order, including
 *    the emitted events. This is alike a transaction receipt.
 * 
 * FAQ:
 * 
 * 1. Q: Why not hold funds in {CourtyardCheckout} and pull them only once an order has been fulfilled?
 *    A: Courtyard aims to facilitate the trading of physical assets and is using the blockchain as a vector to achieve
 *       that mission. Our prices are featured in Fiat currencies by default. While we allow people to use a variety
 *       of cryptocurrencies for convenience, we do not intend to use funds to speculate. Hence, the funds used to pay
 *       for an order via this contract are immediately transferred to Courtyard's receiver account so that they can be
 *       swapped for a stablecoin.
 * 
 * 2. Q: What happens if an order cannot be fulfilled?
 *    A: Our prices are featured in Fiat currencies, but we facilitate payments in cryptocurrencies for our users.
 *       When using a cryptocurrency to pay for an order, a user agrees that they are converting their crypto to the
 *       corresponding value in Fiat in the process. Hence, to avoid complications, any refund sent back to a crypto
 *       wallet would be performed using a stablecoin (USDC by default).
