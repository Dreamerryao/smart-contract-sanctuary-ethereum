    // Welcome to the Fifth Frame Game
    // This game is about getting a bit more technical
    // You'll have to navigate etherscan. all of that without the nice little UIs that dev provide through Websites (minting, OS etc.)
    // With Etherscan, you can see all transactions that happen on the Eth blockchain
    // In addition, you can also explore contracts and interact with them when they are published.
    // When they are not published, you can't... Maybe an unpublished contract can unlock something else...
    // When you can, it means the code is here. Better to look at it before doing anything stupid!
    // 
    // This is a scavenger hunt. The objective is to follow a trail established on etherscan through contracts and transactions.
    // You'll have to read code, interact with contracts, read transactions and their inputs etc.
    // We hid a mint contract where the first 5 can get a free Block Clock.
    // So if you are part of the first 5 to find this contract, you get a free Block Clock
    // If not, you can mint one there: block-clock.xyz
    //
    // There are 2 big types of contracts interactions, Read and Write.
    // Anyone can read a contract. You just need to interact with the functions.
    // To write a function you will have to pay gas!
    //
    // Transactions are a bit more confusing, but when reading closely, you can get a lot out of them.
    //
    // One last thing, the scavenger hunt, will start on Rinkeby and finish on Mainnet.
    // Rinkeby is a test blockchain that mimic the real ETH blockchain (Mainnet)
    // As such, except for the Block-Clock minting contract that will be on Mainnet, you cannot lose money on Rinkeby.
    // You can use any wallet and you will have to switch it to Rinkeby. For ease we'll assume you use Metamask
    // To switch Metamask to Rinkeby, open Metamask. At the top of the window, click where it says "Ethereum Mainnet"
    // It will open a drop down. Select Rinkeby Mainnet.
    // If you don't have this option. Go to Settings>Advanced> Toggle the "Show test networks" button and try again
    // 
    // Good luck.
    // To start, go to: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x6f0840cd52bafe83533912e7ae19996eddb1a89e
