/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

/**
 * @title PaymentSplitter
 * @dev This contract allows to split Ether payments among a group of accounts. The sender does not need to be aware
 * that the Ether will be split in this way, since it is handled transparently by the contract.
 *
 * The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by assigning each
 * account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim
 * an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned.
 *
 * `PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the
 * accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}
 * function.
 *
 * NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether). Rebasing tokens, and
 * tokens that apply fees during transfers, are likely to not be supported as expected. If in doubt, we encourage you
 * to run tests before sending real value to this contract.
