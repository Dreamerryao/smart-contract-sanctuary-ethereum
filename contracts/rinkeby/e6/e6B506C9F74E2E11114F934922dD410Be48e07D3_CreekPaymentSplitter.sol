/**
 * @title CreekPaymentSplitter
 * @dev This contract allows to split Ether payments among a group of accounts. The sender does not need to be aware
 * that the Ether will be split in this way, since it is handled transparently by the contract.
 *
 * The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by assigning each
 * account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim
 * an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned.
 *
 * `PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the
 * accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}
 * function.
 *
 * NOTE: THis contract is a modified version of the original PaymentSplitter
 * contract from the OpenZeppelin library. The original version of the contract is available at:
 * https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/finance/PaymentSplitter.sol
 *
 * The most notable changes to the contract are:
 * - Removal of support for ERC20 tokens to save gas on deployment
 * - The ability to add payees and shares post deployment
 * - The ability to increase users shares
 * - Requries a reentrancy guard to prevent accidental double spending
 * - Requires either owner or the signer to call release
