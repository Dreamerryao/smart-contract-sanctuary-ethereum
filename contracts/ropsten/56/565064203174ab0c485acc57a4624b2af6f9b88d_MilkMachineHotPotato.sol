* Team AppX presents - Moon, Inc. II: Milk Machines | Idle Game + Hot Potato
* Website: https://milk.mooninc.io/
* Discord: https://discord.gg/9Ab8Az3
*
* ====================================*
*
* -> Hot Potato Rules:
* - You can purchase machines (hot potatoes) with ETH to increase your milk production.
* - Each machine can only be owned by one person at a time, and can be purchased by anyone (except the current owner) at anytime.
* - When someone purchases a machines, its value is increased by a certain percentage.
* - Rates: 2% to contract owner; 2% to sponsor sponsor (or contract owner if no sponsor); 6% to Milk Fund; 90% to previous owner
* - overbid will be refunded
*
* -> Idle Game Rules:
* - Each machine you own have a pre-defined milk production rate, which will produce milk over time as long as you're still owning it.
* - You can sell your milk and claim a proportion of the milk fund.
* - You cannot sell milk within the first hour of a new potato starts.
* - The selling price of a milk depends on the Milk Fund and the total milk supply, the formula is:
*   MilkPrice = MilkFund / TotalMilkSupply * Multiplier
*   * Where Multiplier is a number from 0.5 to 1, which starts with 0.5 after a new production unit started, and reaches maximum value (1) after 6 hours.
