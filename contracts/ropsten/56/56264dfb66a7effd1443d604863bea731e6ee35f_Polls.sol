//  Polls: proposals & votes data contract
//
//    This contract is used for storing all data related to the proposals
//    of the senate (galaxy owners) and their votes on those proposals.
//    It keeps track of votes and uses them to calculate whether a majority
//    is in favor of a proposal.
//
//    Every galaxy can only vote on a proposal exactly once. Votes cannot
//    be changed. If a proposal fails to achieve majority within its
//    duration, it can be restarted after its cooldown period has passed.
//
//    The requirements for a proposal to achieve majority are as follows:
//    - At least 1/4 of the currently active voters (rounded down) must have
//      voted in favor of the proposal,
//    - More than half of the votes cast must be in favor of the proposal,
//      and this can no longer change, either because
//      - the poll duration has passed, or
//      - not enough voters remain to take away the in-favor majority.
//    As soon as these conditions are met, no further interaction with
//    the proposal is possible. Achieving majority is permanent.
//
//    Since data stores are difficult to upgrade, all of the logic unrelated
//    to the voting itself (that is, determining who is eligible to vote)
//    is expected to be implemented by this contract's owner.
//
//    Initially, this contract will be owned by the Constitution contract.
