 *  - GAIN Between randomly 2-6% PER 12 HOURS! (every 2950 blocks)
 *  - NO COMMISSION on your investment (every ether stays on contract's balance)
 *  - NO FEES are collected by the owner, in fact, there is no owner at all (just look at the code)
 *
 * How to use:
 *  1. Send any amount of ether to make an investment
 *  2a. Claim your profit by sending 0 ether transaction (every day, every week, i don't care unless you're spending too much on GAS)
 *  OR
 *  2b. Send more ether to reinvest AND get your profit at the same time
 *
 * RECOMMENDED GAS LIMIT: 70000
