    //
    //     - The CEO: The CEO can reassign other roles and change the addresses of our dependent smart
    //         contracts. It is also the only role that can unpause the smart contract. It is initially
    //         set to the address that created the smart contract in the KittyCore constructor.
    //
    //     - The CFO: The CFO can withdraw funds from KittyCore and its auction contracts.
    //
    //     - The COO: The COO can release gen0 kitties to auction, and mint promo cats.
    //
    // It should be noted that these roles are distinct without overlap in their access abilities, the
    // abilities listed for each role above are exhaustive. In particular, while the CEO can assign any
    // address to any role, the CEO address itself doesn't have the ability to act in those roles. This
    // restriction is intentional so that we aren't tempted to use the CEO address frequently out of
    // convenience. The less we use an address, the less likely it is that we somehow compromise the
    // account.
