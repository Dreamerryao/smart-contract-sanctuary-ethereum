This Token Contract implements the standard token functionality (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20) as well as the following OPTIONAL extras intended for use by humans.

This Token will be deployed, and then used by humans - members of Smart City Community - as an utility token as a prepayment for services and Smart House Hardware in SmartCityShop - www.smartcityshop.net .

This token specify
1) Initial Finite Supply (upon creation one specifies how much is minted).
2) In the absence of a token registry: Optional Decimal, Symbol & Name.
3) Optional approveAndCall() functionality to notify a contract if an approval() has occurred.
