/* 
	The following is a lucky draw contract. 
	Steps:
	1. Owner deploy the contract with a list of valid ticket (1 ticket is a address)
	2.  Owner start draw session, allow attender to attend the session.
	3.      Attender scan his ticket (a valid ticket must be in the list from step 1)
	4.  Owner stop draw session and noone will beable to scan anymore
	5.  Owner draw and get the winner
	6. Owner can draw again to get the next winner.
	7. Owner can reset for next draw session
	
	Note 1: Reset function with new list of ticket will clear winner list, reset valid tickets, and clear received tickets
	Note 2: After draw at step 6, winnning ticket will be removed and wont be able to win again at step 7
