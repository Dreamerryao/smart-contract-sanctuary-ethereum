 - Pausing the token prevents everything! need to way to prevent investors from dumping tokens during crowdsale that doesn't prevent minting, etc.
 - No "finishMinting" function because MintableToken is no longer a thing unlike the tutorials
 - Make sure admin is only one that can finalize
 - Make sure admin is only one that can pause
