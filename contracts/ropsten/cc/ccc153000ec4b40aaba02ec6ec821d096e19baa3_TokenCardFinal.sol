/*
    The Dayly Limit:
    The current Smart Contract Triggers the coolDownTime  every time the allowance runs out, and allows for more withdrawal 24 hours later.
    The idea of setting up the schedule every day, was dicarded for security reasons, Ethereum doesnt have a native node clock, Additionally 
    it opens up the front for coordinated attacks on the smart contract. A malicious agent could execute a transaction with thousands of bots
    at 11:59 pm and then withdraw again at 00:01. potentially draining the contract and not giving legitimate users the time to withdraw their 
    funds.
    
    The Allowance Constraints:
    I have also assumed that allowances are not accumulable, so the allowance is "use it or loose it", just like real world banks do it.
    
    The WhiteList:
    An owner can dynamically add or remove any given address into the white list of the smart contract. This addresses would then be able to 
    withdraw as much money as they want so it should be used with care
    
    There is a number of functions that have been created for modularity and code calrity, and are not to be executed as stand alone functions.
    These functions are:
    initialiseValues(); This function is in charge of initialiseng all of the values for user who are withdrawing for the first time,
    its called directly from withdraw so theres no need to execute it independently.
    
    _triggerCooldown(); This function makes sure all the appropriate values are updated when a user withdraws all his Allowance, again it's called 
    from withdrawal so there is not need to call it individually.
