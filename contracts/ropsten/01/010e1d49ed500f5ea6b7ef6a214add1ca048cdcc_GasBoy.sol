/*
  GasBoy proxy contract that executes meta transactions for etherless accounts.

  How it works:
  1) An etherless account crafts a meta transaction and signs it
  2) An approved relay account submits the transaction to the GasBoy and pays the gas
  3) If the meta transaction is valid AND the etherless account has approved GasBoy to 
    transferFrom() CUSD on its behalf, the transaction is executed and the relayer 
    is paid in CUSD from the signer
