ETHEREUM PREMIER LEAGUE : 11th August 2018 - 5th May 2019
    - designed and implemented by Norsefire.
    - special thanks to oguzhanox for his invaluable assistance on the front-end.
 
Rules are as follows:
 
    * Entry to the game costs 1 Ether for the entire season, or 0.25 for a quarter-season.
        - Use the registerFull or registerSeason functions when sending this.
        - Any larger or smaller amounts of Ether, will be rejected.
    * 90% of the entry fee will go towards the prize fund, with 10% forming a cut.
        Of this cut, half goes to the developer, and half goes directly to Giveth (giveth.io/donate).
        The entry fee is the only Ether you will need to send for the duration of the
        season, barring the gas you spend for placing predictions.
    * Buying an entry allows the sender to place predictions on each fixture in the English Premier League,
        barring those which have already kicked off prior to the time a participant enters.
        - Registration for the full season entitles you to predict all 380 fixtures.
        - Registration for a quarter season entitles you to the current set of matchdays in progress
            [1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-41] comprising 100, 90, 85 and 105 games respectively.
    * Predictions can be made (or changed!) at any point up until *midnight UTC* on a given matchday.
        - This is because in a handful of cases, fixtures kick off at different times, and I would
          rather there be a consistent deadline for all fixtures on a matchday.
    * Selecting the correct result for any given game awards the player one point.
    * If a participant reaches a streak of three or more correct predictions in a row, they receive two points
        for every correct prediction from the third game until the streak is broken.
    * If a participant reaches a streak of *five* or more correct predictions in a row, they receive four points
        for every correct prediction from the fifth game until the streak is broken.
 
Prizes:
 
    Depending on whether you are playing in the full season or a quarter-season, your prize pool will be separate.
    (i.e. full season players compete for Pool X, quarter-season players for Pool Y.)
 
    At the end of a quarter-season or full season, the total score aggregated by the top half of players will be
    computed (rounded down if the number of players is odd). Those players who fall within that top half will then
    be able to claim Ether from the relevant prize pool proportional to their percentage of the total score.
 
    e.g. At the end of the first quarter-season, the prize pool is 22.5 Ether (with 100 participants). Of that, the top
    50 scores add up to 20,000. Assuming you placed in the top half of players with 350 points, your reward would be:
 
        22.5 Ether * (350 / 20,000) = 0.3925 Ether.
 
    e.g. At the end of the entire season, the prize pool was 180 Ether (with 200 participants) with the top 100 scores
    adding up to 65,000. Assuming you placed in the top half of players with 900 points, your reward would be:
 
        180 Ether  * (900 / 65,000) = 2.4923 Ether.
