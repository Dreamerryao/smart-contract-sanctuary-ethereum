/// @notice `TierByConstructionClaim` is a base contract for other contracts to

///
/// It builds on `TierByConstruction` with a `claim` function and `_afterClaim`
/// hook.
///
/// The `claim` function checks `onlyTier` and exposes `isTier` for
/// `_afterClaim` hooks so that accounts can self-mint rewards such as erc20,
/// erc1155, erc721, etc. if they meet the tier requirements.
///
/// The `claim` function can only be called once per account.
///
/// Note that `claim` is an unrestricted function and only the tier of the
/// _recipient_ is checked.
///
/// Implementing contracts must be careful to avoid griefing attacks where an
/// attacker calls `claim` against a third party in such a way that their
/// reward is minimised or damaged in some way.
///
/// For example, `ERC20BalanceTier` used with `TierByConstructionClaim` opens
/// the ability for an attacker to `claim` every address they know that has not
/// reached the minimum balance, permanently voiding that address for future
/// claims even if they reach the minimum balance at a later date.
///
/// Another example, `data_` is set to some empty value by the attacker for the
/// `claim` call that voids the ability for the recipient to receive more
/// rewards, had the `data_` been set to some meaningful value.
///
/// The simplest fix is to require `msg.sender` and recipient account are the
/// same, thus requiring the receiver to ensure for themselves that they claim
/// only when and how they want. Of course, this also precludes a whole class

 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

/// `Phase.ONE` is the redemption phase where the token can be redeemed but no
/// longer transferred.
///
/// Redeeming some amount of `RedeemableERC20` burns the token in exchange for
/// some other tokens held by the contract. For example, if the
/// `RedeemableERC20` token contract holds 100 000 USDC then a holder of the
/// redeemable token can burn some of their tokens to receive a % of that USDC.
/// If they redeemed (burned) an amount equal to 10% of the redeemable token
/// supply then they would receive 10 000 USDC.
///
/// Up to 8 redeemable tokens can be registered on the redeemable contract.
/// These will be looped over by default in the `redeem` function. If there is
/// an error during redemption or more than 8 tokens are to be redeemed, there
/// is a `redeemSpecific` function that allows the caller to specify exactly
/// which of the redeemable tokens they want to receive.
/// Note: The same amount of `RedeemableERC20` is burned, regardless of which
/// redeemable tokens were specified. Specifying fewer redeemable tokens will
/// NOT increase the proportion of each that is returned. `redeemSpecific` is
/// intended as a last resort if the caller cannot resolve issues causing
/// errors for one or more redeemable tokens during redemption.
///
/// `RedeemableERC20` has several owner administrative functions:
/// - Owner can add senders and receivers that can send/receive tokens even
///   during `Phase.ONE`
/// - Owner can add to the list of redeemable tokens
///   - But NOT remove them
///   - And everyone can call `redeemSpecific` to override the redeemable list
/// - Owner can end `Phase.ONE` during `Phase.ZERO` by specifying the address
///   of a distributor, which will have any undistributed tokens burned.
///
/// The intent is that the redeemable token contract is owned by a `Trust`
/// contract, NOT an externally owned account. The `Trust` contract will add
/// the minimum possible senders/receivers to facilitate the AMM trading and
/// redemption.
///
/// The `Trust` will also control access to managing redeemable tokens and
/// specifying the trading AMM pool as the distributor to burn to end
/// `Phase.ONE`.
///
/// The redeem functions MUST be used to redeem and burn RedeemableERC20s
/// (NOT regular transfers).
///
/// The `redeem` and `redeemSpecific` functions will simply revert if called
/// outside `Phase.ONE`.
/// A `Redeem` event is emitted on every redemption (per redeemed token) as

/**
 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
 * control mechanisms.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.

///
/// These examples and others are completely antithetical to and undermine the

/// Anon, will you invest YOUR money in anon's project?
///
/// Clearly for every defi blue chip there are 10 000 scams and nothing onchain
/// can stop a scam, this MUST happen at the social layer.
///
/// Rain protocol is agnostic to how this verification happens. A government
/// regulator is going to want a government issued ID cross-referenced against
/// international sanctions. A fan of some social media influencer wants to
/// see a verified account on that platform. An open source software project
/// should show a github profile. A security token may need evidence from an
/// accountant showing accredited investor status. There are so many ways in
/// which BOTH sides of a fundraise may need to verify something about
/// themselves to each other via a THIRD PARTY that Rain cannot assume much.
///
/// The trust model and process for Rain verification is:
///
/// - There are many `Verify` contracts, each represents a specific
///   verification method with a (hopefully large) set of possible reviewers.
/// - The verifyee compiles some evidence that can be referenced by ID in some
///   relevant system. It could be a session ID in a KYC provider's database or
///   a tweet from a verified account, etc. The ID is a `uint256` so should be
///   enough to fit just about any system ID, it is large enough to fit a hash,
///   2x UUIDs or literally any sequential ID.
/// - The verifyee calls `add` _for themselves_ to include their ID under their
///   account, after which they _cannot change_ their submission without
///   appealing to someone who can remove. This costs gas, so why don't we
///   simply ask the user to sign something and have an approver verify the
///   signed data? Because we want to leverage both the censorship resistance
///   and asynchronous nature of the underlying blockchain. Assuming there are
///   N possible approvers, we want ANY 1 of those N approvers to be able to
///   review and approve an application. If the user is forced to submit their
///   application directly to one SPECIFIC approver we lose this property. In
///   the gasless model the user must then rely on their specific approver both
///   being online and not to censor the request. It's also possible that many
///   accounts add the same ID, after all the ID will be public onchain, so it
///   is important for approvers to verify the PAIRING between account and ID.
/// - ANY account with the `APPROVER` role can review the added ID against the
///   records in the system referenced by the ID. IF the ID is valid then the
///   `approve` function should be called by the approver.
/// - ANY account with the `BANNER` role can veto either an add OR a prior
///   approval. In the case of a false positive, i.e. where an account was
///   mistakenly approved, an appeal can be made to a banner to update the
///   status. Bad accounts SHOULD BE BANNED NOT REMOVED. When an account is
///   removed, its onchain state is once again open for the attacker to
///   resubmit a new fraudulent session ID and potentially be reapproved.
///   Once an account is banned, any attempt by the account holder to change
///   their session ID, or an approver to approve will be rejected. Downstream
///   consumers of a `State` MUST check for an existing ban.
///   - ANY account with the `REMOVER` role can scrub the `State` from an
///   account. Of course, this is a blockchain so the state changes are all
///   still visible to full nodes and indexers in historical data, in both the
///   onchain history and the event logs for each state change. This allows an
///   account to appeal to a remover in the case of a MISTAKEN BAN or also in
///   the case of a MISTAKEN ADD (e.g. wrong ID value), effecting a
///   "hard reset" at the contract storage level.
///
/// Banning some account with an invalid session is NOT required. It is
/// harmless for an added session to remain as `Status.Added` indefinitely.
/// For as long as no approver decides to approve some invalid added session it
/// MUST be treated as equivalent to a ban by downstream contracts.
///
/// Rain uses standard Open Zeppelin `AccessControl` and is agnostic to how the
/// approver/remover/banner roles and associated admin roles are managed.
/// Ideally the more credibly neutral qualified parties assigend to each role
/// for each `Verify` contract the better. This improves the censorship
/// resistance of the verification process and the responsiveness of the
/// end-user experience.

/// rights after establishing a more granular and appropriate set of accounts
