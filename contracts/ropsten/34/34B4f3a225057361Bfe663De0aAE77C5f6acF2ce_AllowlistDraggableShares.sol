/**
 * @title Draggable CompanyName AG Shares
 * @author Luzius Meisser, [emailÂ protected]
 *
 * This is an ERC-20 token representing shares of CompanyName AG that are bound to
 * a shareholder agreement that can be found at the URL defined in the constant 'terms'.
 * The shareholder agreement is partially enforced through this smart contract. The agreement
 * is designed to facilitate a complete acquisition of the firm even if a minority of shareholders
 * disagree with the acquisition, to protect the interest of the minority shareholders by requiring
 * the acquirer to offer the same conditions to everyone when acquiring the company, and to
 * facilitate an update of the shareholder agreement even if a minority of the shareholders that
 * are bound to this agreement disagree. The name "draggable" stems from the convention of calling
 * the right to drag a minority along with a sale of the company "drag-along" rights. The name is
 * chosen to ensure that token holders are aware that they are bound to such an agreement.
 *
 * The percentage of token holders that must agree with an update of the terms is defined by the
 * constant UPDATE_QUORUM. The percentage of yes-votes that is needed to successfully complete an
 * acquisition is defined in the constant ACQUISITION_QUORUM. Note that the update quorum is based
 * on the total number of tokens in circulation. In contrast, the acquisition quorum is based on the
 * number of votes cast during the voting period, not taking into account those who did not bother
 * to vote.

 * @dev Implementation of the `IERC20` interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using `_mint`.
 * For a generic mechanism see `ERC20Mintable`.
 *
 * *For a detailed writeup see our guide [How to implement supply
 * mechanisms](https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226).*
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an `Approval` event is emitted on calls to `transferFrom`.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard `decreaseAllowance` and `increaseAllowance`
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See `IERC20.approve`.

 * @title Recoverable
 * In case of tokens that represent real-world assets such as shares of a company, one needs a way
 * to handle lost private keys. With physical certificates, courts can declare share certificates as
 * invalid so the company can issue replacements. Here, we want a solution that does not depend on
 * third parties to resolve such cases. Instead, when someone has lost a private key, he can use the
 * declareLost function to post a deposit and claim that the shares assigned to a specific address are
 * lost. To prevent front running, a commit reveal scheme is used. If he actually is the owner of the shares,
 * he needs to wait for a certain period and can then reclaim the lost shares as well as the deposit.
 * If he is an attacker trying to claim shares belonging to someone else, he risks losing the deposit
 * as it can be claimed at anytime by the rightful owner.
 * Furthermore, if "getClaimDeleter" is defined in the subclass, the returned address is allowed to
 * delete claims, returning the collateral. This can help to prevent obvious cases of abuse of the claim
 * function.
